# Call the Subroutine


Calling the subroutine means telling it to run.

ðŸ‘‰ We need to 'call' the code by adding one more line to our code with the name of the subroutine and the empty `()`:


```python
def rollDice():
  import random
  dice = random.randint(1, 6)
  print("You rolled", dice)

rollDice()
  ```

*Note that when you call the subroutine, you need to ensure you do NOT indent.*

I can even add a range and roll the dice 100 times by adding this code:

```python
for i in range(100):
  rollDice()
```
### ðŸ‘‰ Try it out for yourself!
